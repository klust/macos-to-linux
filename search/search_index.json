It is far from complete and mirrors mostly what I do myself or questions I got in tickets and as such is more of a  partial knowledge base. At the same time it goes further than the documentation provided by the Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum which I work for, but is not as well maintained.</p> <p>Disclaimer: This is unofficial documentation and work-in-progress. It is the result of my work at the  CalcUA service of the University of Antwerp for the  Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum. However, as my main machine for work is macOS-based, this documentation is mostly written when I am working from home.</p>"},{"location":"1_ProtocolsTechnologies/","title":"Protocols and technologies","text":"<p>See the chapter in the \"Using Windows as a client for HPC\" site.</p>"}]}
