# Introduction

This is a guide which is very much a work-in-progress about connecting to supercomputers
from macOS and creating a supercomputer-like environment on the Mac. It is far from complete
and mirrors mostly what I do myself or questions I got in tickets and as such is more of a 
partial knowledge base. At the same time it goes further than the documentation provided by
the [Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum](https://vscentrum.be/) which I work for, but is not as
well maintained.

Disclaimer: This is unofficial documentation and work-in-progress. It is the result of my work at the 
[CalcUA service](https://hpc.uantwerpen.be)
of the [University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/) for the 
[Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum](https://vscentrum.be/). However, as my main machine for work is macOS-based,
this documentation is mostly written when I am working from home.
